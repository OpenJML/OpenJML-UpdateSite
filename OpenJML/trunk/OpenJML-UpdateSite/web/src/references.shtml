The JML web site contains a 
<a href ="http://www.jmlspecs.org/papers.shtml">long list</a> 
of papers relevant to JML
and to program specification and verification. I won't 
duplicate that here. Instead the papers listed here are those
particularly relevant to how a tool like OpenJML is built and 
to the specific
features in JML

<B>THIS LIST IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS</B>
