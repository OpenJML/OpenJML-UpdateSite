
<h2 align="center">OpenJML Installation and Execution</h2>
<p>
OpenJML is a tool for working with logical annotations in Java programs. It
enables static or run-time checking of the validity of the annotations; it also
provides an enhanced version of javadoc that includes the annotations in the
javadoc documentation.
</p>
<p>
The functionality is available 
</p>
<ul>
<li>as a command-line tool to do type-checking, static checking or runtime checking,</li>
<li>as an Eclipse plug-in to perform those tasks, and</li>
<li>programmatically from a user's Java program</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
To install the <b>command-line tool</b>, complete these steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li>download the <a href="openjml.tar.gz">zip file</a> or the <a href="openjml.tar.gz">tar.gz file</a>. 
Then select (possibly create) a folder of your choice to hold the installation, cd to that directory, and either
<ul>
<li>unzip the .zip file: <code>gunzip openjml.zip</code></li>
<li>or, untar the tar.gz file: <code>tar -xvfz openjml.tar.gz</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For static checking, you will need an SMT solver. Make a choice from the
list <a href="#SMT">below</a>, and install it according to its instructions.</li>
</ul> 
<p>
To install the <b>Eclipse plug-in</b>, use the Eclipse mechanism for installing
plug-ins from an update site. Use this URL for the update site: 
<code>http://jmlspecs.sourceforge.net/openjml-updatesite</code>.
The plug-in works with the Eclipse Kepler SR2 and Luna 4.4.0ff releases; 
most functionality may work with the Juno release (Eclipse 4.2.2ff), but support for Juno is deprecated..
</p><p>
The plug-in also needs SMT solvers as described above, for static checking.
</p><p>
Before performing static checking with the plug-in, you need to open the 
OpenJML Solvers preference page, set a default prover (yices2 or z3_4_3),
and enter the absolute path on your system to the prover executable.
</p>

<h2>SMT provers</h2>
<p>
In general, OpenJML can use any SMT-LIBv2-compliant
solver, but since tools vary in their SMT-compliance and their support for various logics, 
adapter code is often needed. OpenJML has been tested with 
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://z3.codeplex.com/">Z3</a> (version 4.3) on Windows and Mac (not quite working yet on Linux)</li>
<li><a href="http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu">CVC4</a> (version 1.2) on Windows</li>
<li><a href="http://yices.csl.sri.com/">Yices</a> (version 2.1) on Windows or Mac OSX</li>
<li>(Linux platforms may well work but have not been tested.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
(Note that Yices does not yet handle quantified 
statements, such as you might use to specify axioms.)
</p>

<a name="Execution"/>
<h2>Execution</h2>

<p>
To execute OpenJML, you need
</p>
<ul>
<li>An appropriate Java VM: Java 7</li>
<li>A copy of the OpenJML release. The release
contains the openjml.jar, jmlspecs.jar, and jmlruntime.jar files.
The release may be installed anywhere you like.</li>
<li>For static checking, an appropriate SMT solver.</li>
</ul>


<p>
There are a few important topics for the user to know:

<li><a href="commandline.shtml">Command-line options</a></li>

</ul>
<p>
These topics are discussed at the indicated links.
</p>

<h3>Type-checking</h3>

<p>
The OpenJML tool operates like a Java compiler, on a set of files.  For example, the command
</p>
<div style="background-color:lightblue">
 <pre>

java -jar openjml.jar -noPurityCheck A.java

</pre> 
</div>
<p>
will type-check the Java and JML in the A.java file and any classes on which it depends.
Include the full absolute or relative path to the openjml.jar file as needed.
(The <code>-noPurityCheck</code> option suppresses many warnings about the use of non-pure functions, since the JDK libraries are not yet populated with appropriate pure annotations.)
</p><p>
For example, put the following text in a file named <code>A.java</code> and execute the command above. 
</p>
<div style="background-color:lightblue">
 <pre>
public class A {

  //@ ensures \result == true;
  public void m() {}

}
</pre> 
</div>
<p>
The following output is obtained:
</p>
<div style="background-color:lightblue">
<pre>
A.java:3: A \result expression may not be used in the specification of a method that returns void
  //@ ensures \result == true;
               ^
1 error
</pre>
</div>


<h3>Static checking</h3>
<p>
To perform static checking of the JML specifications you will need an SMT solver 
to determine logical satisfiability. See the installation instructions and the list
of provers above and select one or more to install on your system.
</p>
<p>
To run the static checker, use a command-line like the following, substituting 
the path to the (in this case Z3) executable in your system. If you are using
yices, substitute "yices2" for "z3_4_3".
</p>
<div style="background-color:lightblue">
<pre>

java -jar openjml.jar -esc -prover z3_4_3 -exec <em>path-to-executable</em> -noPurityCheck B.java

</pre>
</div>
<p>
For example, place the following text in the file <code>B.java</code> and execute the command above.
</p>
<div style="background-color:lightblue">
 <pre>
public class B {

  static int j,k;

  //@ requires i >= 0;
  //@ modifies j;
  //@ ensures j == i;
  public static void setj(int i) {
    k = i;
  }

  //@ ensures j == 1;
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    setj(3);
  }

}
</pre> 
</div>


<p>
The following output is produced:
</p>
<div style="background-color:lightblue">
 <pre>
B.java:9: warning: The prover cannot establish an assertion (Assignable) in method setj
    k = i;
      ^
B.java:6: warning: Associated declaration
  //@ modifies j;
      ^
B.java:13: warning: The prover cannot establish an assertion (Postcondition) in method main
  public static void main(String[] args) {
                     ^
B.java:12: warning: Associated declaration
  //@ ensures j == 1;
      ^
4 warnings
</pre> 
</div>
<ul>
<li>The first two warnings point out that the specification of the method <code>setj</code> states that the field <code>j</code> (and nothing else) is modified by the method, but the method actually modifies <code>k</code>.
</li>
<li>The second pair of warnings points out that the call of <code>setj</code> in method <code>main</code> does not satisfy the postcondition; the "Associated declaration" warning that follows indicates the violated postcondition.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Runtime assertion checking</h3>
<p>
To compile the JML specifications in the given files and in any files that they reference as assertions to be checked at runtime, use the -rac option:
</p>
<div style="background-color:lightblue">
<pre>

java -jar openjml.jar -rac -noPurityCheck B.java

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Then execute this command (the jmlruntime.jar is part of the OpenJML installation -- include the full path to that library as needed)
</p>
<div style="background-color:lightblue">
<pre>

java -classpath ".;jmlruntime.jar" B

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The following output is produced:
</p>
<div style="background-color:lightblue">
<pre>
B.java:9: JML An item is assigned that is not in the assignable statement
    k = i;
      ^
B.java:6: Associated declaration
  //@ modifies j;
      ^
B.java:8: JML postcondition is false
  public static void setj(int i) {
                     ^
B.java:7: Associated declaration
  //@ ensures j == i;
      ^
B.java:14: JML postcondition is false
    setj(3);
        ^
B.java:7: Associated declaration
  //@ ensures j == i;
      ^
B.java:13: JML postcondition is false
  public static void main(String[] args) {
                     ^
B.java:12: Associated declaration
  //@ ensures j == 1;
      ^
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Here you see a postcondition failure reported both by <code>setj</code>, which checks the postconditions on exit, and by <code>main</code>, which checks the postconditions of methods it calls when they return.
In addition, the postcondition of <code>main</code> fails when <code>main</code> itself exits.
</p>

<h3>Producing documentation</h3>
To produce javadoc files with JML specifications inserted, use the following command:
<div style="background-color:lightblue">
<pre>

java -jar openjml.jar -doc -noPurityCheck </code><i>files-or-packages</i>

</pre>
</div>
 -->
