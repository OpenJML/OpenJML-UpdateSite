<h2>JML</h2>
<p>
The Java Modeling Language (JML) is a language in which the functional behavior of Java classes 
can be described.
The descriptions of behavior are expressed as structured 
Java comments or Java annotations that use Java-like logical expressions. Various tools can then read the JML 
information and do static checking, runtime checking, display for documentation,
or other useful tasks.
</p>
<p>
More information about JML can be found on the 
<a href="http://www.jmlspecs.org">JML web site</a>.
The information includes publications, groups using or contributing to JML, 
mailing lists, etc.
There is also a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmlspecs/">sourceforge project</a>,
including a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jmlspecs/wiki/Home">wiki</a> for JML.
</p>
<h2>OpenJML</h2>
<p>
OpenJML is a tool set for JML, built on the OpenJDK framework for Java.
It is intended as the replacement for ESC/Java2, which is only for Java 1.4.
OpenJML is current with Java 1.7u40.
This page makes available some resources for OpenJML.
OpenJML is a work in progress.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note that OpenJML is not a theorem prover or model checker itself.</b> OpenJML 
translates JML specifications into <a href="http://www.smtlib.org">SMT-LIB format</a> and passes the proof 
problems implied by the Java+JML program to backend SMT solvers. Success in checking
the specifications against the code will depend on 
</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) the capability of the
backend SMT solver, </li>
<li>(b) the particular encoding of code+specifications into SMT by OpenJML, and</li>
<li>(c) the complexity and style of writing the code and specifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Correspondingly, key goals of OpenJML are to provide challenge problems to 
SMT solvers (point a), particularly around quantified expressions,
to experiment with the encoding of code and specifications in OpenJML itself (point b)
and to allow users to easily experiment with styles of specification writing (point c).

A summary of the features and the implementation status of OpenJML is 
<a href="features.shtml">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that OpenJML requires an OpenJDK build of Java 1.7 to run.
Such builds can be obtained from 
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads">the Oracle release site</a>.

The source code for OpenJML is kept in sourceforge as a module of the 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jmlspecs/code/HEAD/tree/">JML Project</a>.
The JMLAnnotations and Specs projects (also modules of JML) are used by OpenJML.
Information about creating a developer's environment for the OpenJML source
can be found below.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
The OpenJML user guide is part of the download, but is also available 
<a href="OpenJMLUserGuide.pdf">here</a>.
There is also an <a href="onlinemanual.shtml">online user guide</a>.
These documents are works in progress.
</p>

<h3>Command-line tool</h3>
<p>
The OpenJML command line tool can be downloaded as a
<a href="openjml.tar.gz">tar.gz file</a> or a <a href="openjml.zip">zip file</a>.
</p>


<h3>Eclipse plug-in</h3>
<p>
The Update site for the Eclipse plug-in that encapsulates the OpenJML tool
is <a href="http://jmlspecs.sourceforge.net/openjml-updatesite">http://jmlspecs.sourceforge.net/openjml-updatesite</a>.
</p>


<h3>Development of OpenJML</h3>
<p>Developers contributing to OpenJML can retrieve a project-set file to download source code from SVN and create the corresponding projects within Eclipse from 
<a href="OpenJML-projectSet.psf">here</a>.
</p>
<p>Alternately, the set of SVN commands needed to checkout all the pieces of the
OpenJML source code into the directory structure expected by Eclipse is
<a href="svn_commands">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
The general instructions for setting up a development environment are found on the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/jmlspecs/wiki/OpenJmlSetup">JML wiki</a>.
